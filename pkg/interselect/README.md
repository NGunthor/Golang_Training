---

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
```
<b>Note</b><br>
<li>Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.<br>
<li>The result can be in any order.
